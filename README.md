# Demo schedule application

This is a demo schedule application made in ReactJS. It utilizes React concepts like:
<ul>
  <li>React Redux (reduxjs/toolkit)</li>
  <li>Hooks, custom hooks</li>
  <li>State and Effect management</li>
  <li>API requests</li>
  <li>React Portals</li>
  <li>Inclusion of third party libraries like "materialui" and "react-icons"</li>
  <li>UI support for phone and computer screens</li>
</ul>

The idea of the application is to be a schedule app geared towards studens. It makes an effort to help them keep track of complex and convoluted schedules.
